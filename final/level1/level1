#CS615-Level1
#The Matrix

#Problem:
This message must contain the secret passphrase.  This passphrase
has been made available to you in a file conveniently readable by
anybody on a system you have access to.

To help you find that file, here is it's checksum:

76e78deccf884b12e7b542712461fcd5b0fd8ddb14b28ccedf3629d9a635d7a1

#Result
The checksum is 256 bits long,so we think it is sha256.So we want to use sha256 to check all the file in the linux-lab.
the command is :
```
find . -exec sha256sum {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep 76e78deccf884b12e7b542712461fcd5b0fd8ddb14b28ccedf3629d9a635d7a1
```

but it didn't work in the linux-lab root direction,a lot of direction we can't access.
so we want to try it in the `~jschauma/cs_html/`,but we can't use `ls` command.
First,we check the `~jschauma/cs_html/615` and find nothing.So I have tried some other direction name like "tmp".
Finally,we found the `~jschauma/cs_html/tmp` and use the command to check the file sha256.

the result is :
```
76e78deccf884b12e7b542712461fcd5b0fd8ddb14b28ccedf3629d9a635d7a1  ./org/postgresql/sess_d3vp903ivee5tnonbd99ljru77
```

In the file 
```
The passphrase is: "Octopuses have three hearts."
